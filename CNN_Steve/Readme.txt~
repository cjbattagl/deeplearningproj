Load one video and do the following two things: 
1. generate the feature matrix
2. make prediction frame-by-frame

command: qlua run.lua (-v your_video)

It will do the following steps:
1. load the video from ../Dataset/..... (You need to download the UCF-11 first)
2. load the pre-trained model ("NIN" network) & the ImageNet labels
3. process the video & make prediction frame-by-frame

After running these codes, a new empty folder "out_frames" will be generated. You can ignore it. That's only for debugging.
