\section{Introduction}
Deep convolutional neural networks are currently the leading technique for image classification.
Convolutional layers capture patterns with spatial locality, while deep topologies capture the compositional nature of images.
The problem of \emph{video} classification introduces a new, temporal dimension not leveraged by typical 2D CNNs. For instance, a video of a human subject may contain temporal concepts such as gestures or gait that cannot be extracted from a single frame. This prompts the question:
 how can we best capture the additional information contained within this temporal dimension?   

There are indeed methods of preprocessing temporal information into a single 2-dimensional input~\cite{brox}, but a more attractive research goal is to develop a neural network that can discover temporal relationships on its own.
There are multiple recent approaches towards this goal, but as of yet no consensus on which is superior.

The difficulties in training neural networks on video input include the following: memory requirements (particularly if 3D convolutions are used), fewer public data sets, size of the data sets (for instance, the Sports-1M data set is $\approx 4TB$ large), and a lack of consensus on which structural approaches are most effective.

In just the last two years, a variety of techniques have been investigated, including 3-dimensional convolutional neural networks (3D-CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). Additional techniques have been incorporated within these strategies, such as slow-fusion, optical-flow, and retraining of pre-trained ImageNet networks.

The purpose of this project is to examine and compare these approaches, while comparing to an additional, novel technique that we introduce that uses a second CNN layer to extract temporal information from sequentially-generated ImageNet vectors. 

We make the following contributions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Implement and analyze a 2D-CNN $\to$ LSTM architecture for video classification.
\item Introduce and analyze a novel 2D-CNN $\to$ 2D-CNN architecture for video classification. 
\item Investigate the effect of replacing the first CNN with novel ImageNet architectures.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Background}
While neural networks were once limited to small, toy applications, 
their power has increased dramatically due to the explosion in data 
due to social media and the rise in computational power due to GPUs. 
The ImageNet data set~\cite{imagenet}, containing millions of labeled images, has become a standard image-classification benchmark, with improvements each year from architectural tweaks~\cite{alexnet,vggnet,nin,resnet}.

With video input we must process a collection of frames. Incorporating the changes between these frames then becomes the new research problem. \emph{Slow fusion} is one of the first approaches taken, which uses multiple windows of frames. Each window is used as an input to a separate CNN, which is then combined with the results of the other convolutions into a later CNN~\cite{cnnvid}. This allows for short-term and longer-term temporal information to be taken into account. 

If a video is taken to be a projection of 3D objects onto a 2D plane, the point-wise velocities of the projected objects corresponds to a 2D motion field. Optical flow is an approximation of this field produced through analyzing consecutive frames~\cite{brox}, and is a popular feature in the video classification approaches we have examined. Unfortunately, computing optical flow accurately is numerically intensive. 

A more natural approach is to simply extend the 2-dimensional CNN to 3 dimensions, where the third dimension is temporal. While applying a 2D convolution kernel to a 2D or 3D volume will produce a 2D volume, applying a 3D convolution kernel to a 3D volume produces another 3D volume, as illustrated in~\RefFigure{fig:3dconv}. This allows the model to incorporate the temporal dimension as an intrinsic aspect at all levels of the network, as opposed to flattening it out early on. 
\begin{figure}[ht]

  \includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{figs/3dconv}
  \caption{Applying a 3D convolution produces another 3D volume.}
  \label{fig:3dconv}
\end{figure}

Another approach uses Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), which are neural networks which allow self-loops, and thus unfold over a time dimension. A crucial innovation for RNNs is Long Short-Term Memory(LSTM)~\cite{LSTM}, which uses memory cells to store, modify,
and access an internal state. While a standard RNN is limited to storing parameters related to a fixed window of time, LSTMs can discover long-range
temporal relationships. The internal mechanisms of LSTM allow this discovery to selectively store and forget the necessary information, allowing a limited number of parameters to represent a global view of the data. 

\subsection{Related Work}
%What has been done in similar fields/problems? What are the limitations of current approaches?
%Recurrent long-term convolutional models are most frequently used in speech and language applications, but it is possible to apply them to visual time-series data. 
One popular approach is to apply a 2D-CNN to each frame of the video, followed by an RNN with LSTM~\cite{ltrcn}. 
Another approach is slow-fusion, which applies multiple frames to the input at the same time~\cite{cnnvid}. This approach, applied to a simply CNN, shows only a modest improvement over CNN single-frame learning.
% Tran, et al. demonstrated that using 3D-CNNs instead of 2D can achieve state-of-the-art results on several data sets~\cite{stf}.
Tran, et al. demonstrated that using a 3D Convolutional Neural Network, it is possible to build a classifier on a moving window of frames using 3D convolutions to extract useful local movement information, and it can achieve state-of-the-art results on several data sets~\cite{stf}. However, 3D-CNNs introduce a massive memory blowup that may make training infeasible on GPUs.
Ng, et al. demonstrate that instead of training on `short snippets' (such as in~\cite{cnnvid,stf}), an LSTM approach allows us to train on entire videos efficiently~\cite{snip}, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on several data sets. Furthermore, Hu, et al \cite{cnnMNLS} demonstrate in natural language processing that instead of using another RNN (or LSTM), CNN can also be used as temporal encoder to extract sequence of information from sentenses. 

Many of these papers incorporate additional features such as optical flow~\cite{brox} and improved dense trajectory, both of which involve optimization techniques applied to subsets of frames. 
\section{Approach and Techniques}
%What is your proposed approach to solving the problem? How does it compare to existing approaches?
%Note: It's OK for these projects to be similar to existing approaches, although if you want to publish the results they will have to have some novelty.
We have decided on combining two possible approaches, which address
the third, temporal dimension in different ways: Convolutional Neural
Networks (3D-CNNs or CNN as temporal encoder)~\cite{stf,cnnvid,cnnMNLS} and Long
Short-Term Memory /Recurrent Neural Networks (Regular or Multi-dimensional LSTM)~\cite{ltrcn}. 

\subsection{Baseline}
Our baseline model is constructed from the pretrained ImageNet CNN. We fine-tuned the pretrained CNN model with extra two fully connected layers, and we apply this fine-tuned CNN model to each of the input frames. A simple averaging process is used on the set of output vectors to produce a predicted class-- essentially implementing a vote. This is shown in~\reffig{fig:cnn}. 
\begin{figure}

  \caption{Static CNN Network}
  \label{fig:cnn}
\end{figure}

% \subsection{3D CNN}
% % 3D-CNNs
% Using a 3D Convolutional Neural Network, it is possible to build a classifier on a moving window
% of frames using 3D convolutions to extract useful local movement information. However, 3D-CNNs introduce a massive memory blowup that may make training infeasible on GPUs.
% To address this, we would like to use the slow-fusion model~\cite{cnnvid} instead of 3D kernels. In addition, we also plan to apply 3D kernels to one or two layers to check the improvement if we don't meet the memory problem.


% LSTM
\subsection{RNN with LSTM}
An RNN with LSTM approach is able to build the classifier with long term memory using a much larger number of frames at once. 
Also for applications involve temporal informations, it is natural to apply RNN. In this approach, we basically follow the work from ~\cite{ltrcn} and implement the RNN with LSTM which is designed for taking image features as input. The CNN is this LRCN model serves as a translator which converts the raw image pixel into meaningful representations for machines. On the other hand, the RNN serves as the decision module to decide whether if this video belongs to a certain types of classes. 
This approach is illustrated in~\reffig{fig:lcrn}.
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{figs/lcrn}
  \caption{LRCN Network}
  \label{fig:lcrn}
\end{figure}

% Furthermore, the current LSTM model is built on the fully-connected
% layer, which does not conserve spatial information. We would like to examine the 
% effectiveness of adding the LSTM network at earlier layers.
% If we apply LSTM directly after the convolution layer,
% the input to LSTM model is actually multi-dimensional tensor. To address
% this challenge, we would like to apply the multi-dimensional LSTM
% \cite{byeon2015scene} to efficiently take advantage of the spatial
% information following an early convolution layer. 

\subsection{Temporal CNN}
% CNN + CNN (1D convolution) ==> Yan
In addition to using the LSTM model for the temporal encoder, convolutional architecture(CNN) has also been applied to model sentences using a pre-trained embedding of words ~\cite{cnnSC,cnnMNLS}. We would like to explore this idea and see how it performs on high level applications, like video classification. First, similar to what we did for LCRN model described above, a pre-trained CNN architecture can be applied as spatial encoder to each frame to extract features. 
Secondly, we concatenated feature vectors into a feature matrix and apply CNN on this particular temporal feature matrix. The CNN with 1D or 2D convolutional kernels will be applied to the temporal feature matrix separately to verify their influences. For 1D CNN, we take 1D convolution on a sliding window of the concatenated feature vectors along with the temporal direction. For 2D CNN, we apply 2D convolution and 2D max-pooling directly on the a sliding window of the feature matrix from the spatial encoder. This approach is illustrated in~\reffig{fig:tnn}.
The idea behind this temporal CNN is that, CNN is known for extracting the stationary informations in the image (or feature matrix). Using this feature of CNN and apply directly on feature matrices contain temporal information can be interpreted as: we are exploring some of the distinct feature elements that consistently show up for most of the feature vectors in different time steps, and with different hierarchical layers from CNN to explore the correlation of these elements. All these distinct features and their correlations in each of the video will determine which type of activities for this video.

\section{Experiments}
\subsection{Data Set}
We propose to begin with a well-established data set such as UCF-101~\cite{ucf101}, which contains 13320 videos from 101 action categories. For early training purposes we may use only a small subset of these actions, such as a subset of 10 sports. The ultimate goal is applying our framework to Sports-1M~\cite{cnnvid}, which contains around 1 million YouTube videos belonging to 487 categories. In this way, we can compare our methods with the current state-of-the-art methods.

\subsection{Experimental Methodology}
%What specific experiments are you planning on conducting? How are they testing the specific problem you want to solve?
For training we plan to use the Jinx cluster at Georgia Tech. Each node is equipped with 2 nVidia Tesla M2090 ``Fermi'' GPU cards, and CPU nodes with large memory are available.

The following is a set of proposed experiments, some of which we have started:
\begin{itemize}
\item Move 2D-LSTM within convolution layers to see if this better incorporates spatial information.
\item Incorporate slow fusion within a 2D-CNN to see if this input approach yields higher accuracy.
\item Replace a 2D-CNN-LSTM network with a Shallow ResNet-LSTM network (with or without slow fusion)-- to see if ResNet provides significant gains over the AlexNet used by existing studies.
\item Study if slow-fusion \emph{combined} with optical-flow input provides significantly better results than either approach on its own.
\item Using CNN + LSTM as base line compare with the performance from CNN + 1D-CNN/2D-CNN.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Results}
In~\RefFigure{fig:demo} we show an example of the video output that our model produces. The first label is the result from the TCNN model, and the second label from the LSTM model. In this case, the TCNN model made a misprediction. 
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{figs/demo}
  \caption{Example of video output.}
  \label{fig:demo}
\end{figure}

In~\RefFigure{fig:cnntest} we see the training and testing error for the baseline model. The ResNet model performs over 10\% better than the NIN model, which is about the difference we'd expect for static image classification. 
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{figs/CNNout}
  \caption{CNN Training and Test Error}
  \label{fig:cnntest}
\end{figure}

We present the training results for the LSTM model in~\RefFigure{fig:lstmtest}. The models vary in which ImageNet model is used for the first layet. Again, we see that ResNet performs the strongest, and that the deeper ResNet networks perform incrementally better than shallower ones.

\end{figure}

The testing results for our novel TCNN method are presented in~\RefFigure{fig:tnntest}. Using ResNet followed by 2 convolutional layers provided the strongest results, followed by using a single convolutional layer.

\section{Conclusion}
Perhaps the most noticeable result is that the quality of the first convolutional layer is very important. We were able to see excellent improvements in quality just by using ResNet in place of earlier ImageNet models. While we used a standard pretrained ImageNet model for this layer, we might expect improvements of 5-10\% by further training this first layer on relevant video classes. 

Data volume is very important. We had 10000 videos in our data set, but C3D was able to train on one million videos, as well as a proprietary Facebook data set. In earlier work, Karpathy, et al. demonstrated that additional training on the Sports-1M data-set raised their testing accuracy on UCF-101 from 41.3\% to 65.4\%~\cite{cnnvid}, so we would expect large gains from training on a larger data set as well.

The temporal CNN was not as effective as the LSTM model, and in fact only performed incrementally better than the raw CNN model. Performing convolutions across feature vectors is tricky. 

One of the possible future work can be using multi-dimensional LSTM. The current LSTM model is built on the fully-connected layer, which does not conserve spatial information. We would like to examine the effectiveness of adding the LSTM network at earlier layers. If we apply LSTM directly after the convolution layer, the input to LSTM model is actually multi-dimensional tensor. To address this challenge, we would like to apply the multi-dimensional LSTM
\cite{byeon2015scene} to efficiently take advantage of the spatial information following an early convolution layer.
