\subsection{Motivation}
%What problem are you trying to solve? Why is this hard right now?

\subsection{Related Work}
%What has been done in similar fields/problems? What are the limitations of current approaches?

%Recurrent long-term convolutional models are most frequently used in speech and language applications, but it is possible to apply them to visual time-series data. 


Long-term recurrent convolutional networks:~\cite{ltrcn}

Large-scale video classification:~\cite{cnnvid}

Learning Spatio-temporal features:~\cite{stf}
\subsection{Approach and Techniques}
%What is your proposed approach to solving the problem? How does it compare to existing approaches?
%Note: It's OK for these projects to be similar to existing approaches, although if you want to publish the results they will have to have some novelty.

\subsection{Data Set}
%What data are you planning to apply your approach to?

\TODO{Describe the video data set...}
\subsection{Experimental Methodology}
%What specific experiments are you planning on conducting? How are they testing the specific problem you want to solve?

For training we plan to use the Jinx cluster at Georgia Tech. Each node is equipped with 2 nVidia Tesla M2090 ``Fermi'' GPU cards.
\subsection{Group Tasking}
%A plan of breaking up the project (who will do what). Note that all team members must make a meaningful/significant contribution (i.e. not just do the reporting/posters).
