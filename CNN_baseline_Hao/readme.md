### CNN baseline
This folder construct a baseline to train the fully connected layer from the feature vector from UCF101 for video classification. The codes includes: 

- data.lua  : read feature vectors 
- model.lua : Specify the model structure, the current structure is 2048->512->101 
- run.lua   : run the entire script
- test.lua  : Testing by output label for each frame and then a final voting is used
- train.lua : Sample one frame for each video in each iteration of the SGD. 
- givelabel.lua :generate labels for each testing images by using the saved model file

### Implementation
All of code is implemented by Hao Yan, and some of the code referred to the torch [tutorial](https://github.com/torch/tutorials/tree/master/2_supervised) and HW of the CNN assignments. More specifically,  I sample one frame from each video for each training samples. In the testing, I will generate label for each frame in the video and implement a final voting procedure to decide the final classification result. 

## Requirement
This baseline methods take the **feature vectors** generated by the pretrained CNN models as input. we use the same training and testing list provided by UCF101 and the feature vectors. 
 

* [Features for training](https://www.dropbox.com/s/b0gbo7psouxeu2c/data_UCF101_train_1.t7?dl=0)
* [Features for testing](https://www.dropbox.com/s/98fr9df1r4nl18v/data_UCF101_test_1.t7?dl=0)

After you downloaded the feature vectors, please modify the code in *./CNN_baseline/data.lua* to the director where you put your feature vector files. 

### Usage: 
qlua run.lua --model Linear
