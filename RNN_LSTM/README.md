This is rather a note for me to remember what experiments have been done and what needs to be done in order to moving forward. 

---
TODO: 
- [ ] Experiment with different number of frames for training
- [x] Experiment with different batch size and learning rate
- [ ] train with different optimizers, like sgd, adam, adamax, rmsprop
- [ ] comparison between GRU and LSTM
